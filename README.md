# 📊 Student Social Media Usage Analysis — Python Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
Social media platforms have become integral to student life, offering connectivity and entertainment. However, **overuse can harm mental health, sleep, productivity, and academic performance**.  
As part of a **Mental Wellness Research Team**, this project analyzes student social media usage patterns, demographic influences, and addiction trends to guide awareness campaigns and digital detox programs.

## 🎯 Objective
Leverage **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)** to:
- Explore the dataset
- Perform cleaning and analysis
- Visualize patterns
- Tell a compelling **data-driven story** that supports mental wellness initiatives

## 🛠️ Tasks & Guidelines
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Load dataset, handle missing values, correct data types  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Study relationships: Age, Gender, Daily Usage, Sleep, Academic Performance, Social Interaction  

3. **Aggregation & Insights**  
   - Group data by Gender, Age Group, Education Level  
   - Find average addiction levels across demographics  

4. **Functions & Logic**  
   - Build custom functions to classify addiction risk (Low/Medium/High)  
   - Suggest digital detox strategies with conditionals  

5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Use at least 4 chart types (Bar, Pie, Heatmap, Line)  
   - Each visualization includes labels, titles, and short insights  

6. **Storytelling Deliverable**  
   - Summarize findings in a **10-line story** covering key patterns and root causes  

---

## 🚀 Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset  
- Python notebook/script (`.ipynb` or `.py`)  
- Visualizations with insights  
- Final 10-line story summary
